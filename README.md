# Google-DA-Capstone-Project
## A case study on the cyclistic data set

This repository consists of the Capstone project that I completed as a part of Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

The Course can be found here [click](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics).

In this case study, I used data from a fictional bike rental company based in Chicago, Cyclist, to try to determine and understand the main differences between annual members and casual rider. With such insights, I was able to deliver recommendations, with which the company has developed a marketing campaign aimed at converting casual riders to annual members, and hence maximizing the growth of the company.
